# What does it do?
Short: A (very basic) interactive console for C using python and GCC, since there currently doesnt seem to be any available.<br/>
Long: For people who just start to learn C, there is a need to carry out tiny experiments to learn (e.g. define a pointer and check if its mutable, play around with string constants and array etc.). Ideally this would be done using an intervative console similar to the python console, jshell (console for Java), node etc. <br/>

# Usage
To run: python3 cli.py <br\>
To exit: type 'exit' on the console <br/>

# Future scope
1. Fix error throwing, enable ^ to access recently used lines and implement other trivial functionalities.
2. Option to save the final script build interactively. (might be useful ?)

If you have any other ideas please let me know on the issues page :)
